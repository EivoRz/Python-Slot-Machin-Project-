# Python-Slot-Machine-Project-

This Python code represents a simple slot machine game. The slot machine has a 3x3 grid with various symbols ("A," "B," "C," "D"). Players can deposit money, choose the number of lines to bet on (up to 3), and set a bet amount per line. After each spin, the machine generates a random arrangement of symbols, checks for winning combinations on the selected lines, and calculates winnings based on predefined symbol counts and values. The game continues until the player decides to quit, and the final balance is displayed.
